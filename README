DOCUMENTATION

web/howto.txt and web/index.html contain basic documentation about the library. doc contains the full javadoc.

SOURCE

The full source code of the library is in src/. The library itself is in the package src/hermes, and testing code is in src/hermesTest.

TO BUILD:
Use the provided Ant build script in the Resources folder. You may have to do some tweaking to get it working on your operating system. At the least, you'll have to update the properties defined in build.properties to the correct paths for your computer. You may have to tweak build.xml as well to get it working. The build is currently configured to exclude the tests; please don't change this.

EXAMPLES

The examples/ folder contains a number of examples of the library in action. These are also in the ZIP in distribution.

BINARIES

distribution/Hermes-0.1.1 contains all files necessary for use of the library, with installation instructions. This requires Processing 1.2 or higher, and the JRE 1.5 or higher.

BUILDING

Building the library requires the JDK 1.5 or higher. resources/build.xml is an Ant script for building, although it must be configured specifically for your system. Consult build_readme.html for more info.
