	 * Hermes.World's main event loop provides support for interactions that require
	 * multiple iterations during a single loop. For example, when performing collision
	 * detection on a fast-moving object the object's position will be sampled at several points
	 * along the path for accuracy. If an interaction returns false, this mean that this
	 * interaction has not been fully resolved. For any interaction that has not been 
	 * fully resolved, the world will continue to check both beings in the interaction against
	 * ALL other beings they are capable of interacting with, until all interactions
	 * have been resolved. Note that this can cause a serious hit to performance,
	 * and can also cause infinite loops, so be careful when using this feature.
